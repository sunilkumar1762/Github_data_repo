# Analyzing GitHub Repository Data

Problem Statement::
Analyzing GitHub Repository Data to uncover patterns and trends.

Description::
This project involves collecting GitHub repository data, cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand repository patterns, visualizing the results, and creating a dashboard to monitor GitHub repository trends.

Data::
The data used for this project is in the CSV format and contains various metrics for GitHub repositories such as stars, forks, watchers, issues, commits, branches, releases, and contributors.

Steps Involved::

Data Collection:

Load the GitHub repository data from a CSV file.

Data Cleaning::

Inspect the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies.
Convert relevant columns to numeric values.
Handle missing data appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct EDA to uncover patterns and insights.
Plot distributions and relationships between different metrics.
Visualizations:

Create various plots to visualize the data and trends:
Distribution of repositories by the number of commits.
Top repositories by the number of forks.
Relationship between stars and forks.
Relationship between stars and watchers.
Box plots to compare distributions.
Pie chart of the proportion of issues, forks, and stars.
Dashboard Creation:

Develop a dashboard to monitor GitHub repository trends.

Conclusion::
This project provides an in-depth analysis of GitHub repository data, showcasing various visualizations and insights that can help monitor and understand repository trends. The dashboard created from this analysis can be used to track these trends over time and make data-driven decisions.
